## COLD OPEN (1 min)

> "I run two companies. I have a full-time job. I have two kids under five. And I just started a podcast.
>
> *(beat)*
>
> I know. I can hear you already. 'Joshua, are you okay? Do you need help? Is this a cry for help?'
>
> No. Well... maybe. But not the kind you're thinking.
>
> People ask me all the time — 'You're already stretched thin. Why add more to your plate?'
>
> And here's the thing — I'm not adding more. I'm building a system that makes everything else work better. The podcast isn't another thing on the list. It's the thing that ties the list together.
>
> That probably sounds like something a crazy person would say. Stick with me for twenty minutes and I'll explain."

---

## INTRO (45 sec)

> "Welcome to The Builder's Frequency. I'm Joshua Levy — test engineer by day, founder by night, and apparently a podcaster now.
>
> This is where we talk about building things that matter: businesses, systems, and a life worth passing down.
>
> This is episode one. So let me tell you who I am, why I'm doing this, and what you can expect if you stick around. Consider this our first date. I promise to be interesting. Or at least not boring. The bar is low — most podcasts put me to sleep, so I figure I'm already ahead."

## MY STORY - THE SETUP (4 min)

> "Let me give you the quick background.
>
> During the day, I'm a Senior Test and Validation Engineer at Sonance. If you don't know Sonance, we make speakers. Good ones. The kind that go in ceilings and walls and make your house sound like a movie theater. I've been in audio engineering for over a decade now — test automation, quality systems, making sure products don't ship broken. It's deeply unsexy work, but someone has to make sure the thing actually works before it ends up in your living room.
>
> And I love it. I genuinely do. There's something satisfying about building systems that catch problems before customers do. You'll never see my name on a product, but if your speaker works the way it's supposed to? You're welcome.
>
> *(beat)*
>
> But that's my day job. That's the 9-to-5 — or more accurately, the 8-to-6, because let's be honest about how corporate jobs actually work.
>
> After hours, I run Josh Levy Labs. It's a test engineering consultancy. Companies hire me to help them build the systems I build at my day job — test strategy, automation, quality infrastructure. Turns out there's a market for 'guy who knows how to make sure your product doesn't suck.'
>
> I'm also president of a company called The Lyceum. We're building software for audio testing. If that sounds niche, it's because it is. But niche is good. Niche means less competition and customers who actually need what you're building.
>
> Oh, and I have two sons. Jones is almost 3 and Jett is 7 months old — yes, we accidentally gave our kids names that sound like a law firm. Jones & Jett, Attorneys at Naptime. My wife Jill is somehow still married to me, which honestly might be the most impressive thing on my résumé.
>
> She deserves a medal. Or at least a really nice vacation. We're working on it."

## MY STORY - THE TENSION (3 min)

> "So here's the thing nobody tells you about having a stable job AND building things on the side.
>
> For years, I felt like I was living a double life. Like I was two different people. There's Joshua-at-work, who's collaborative and professional and sits in meetings about Q3 roadmaps. And then there's Joshua-at-5-AM, who's coding automation scripts and sending invoices and trying to figure out why the database is throwing errors again.
>
> Maybe you know this feeling. You go to work, you do good work — you might even like your job. But there's this thing inside you that won't shut up. This voice that says, 'This is fine, but what if you built something of your own? What if you didn't need permission to ship?'
>
> And if you've felt that, you've probably also heard the conventional wisdom. The Gary Vee advice. The hustle culture gospel.
>
> 'Quit your job. Go all in. Burn the boats. If you're not all-in, you're not serious.'
>
> *(beat)*
>
> I call BS on that.
>
> Look, I'm not saying there's never a time to quit. Some people should quit. Some situations demand it. But this idea that you have to choose — that you're either an entrepreneur OR an employee — that's a false binary. And I think it's actually dangerous advice for most people.
>
> Because here's what nobody mentions: Most businesses fail. The stats are brutal. And if you've burned your boats and your business goes under, now you're unemployed AND broke AND explaining to your spouse why you thought selling artisanal dog treats was a sure thing.
>
> There's another way."

## THE FRAMEWORK - LEVERAGE (3 min)

> "Here's what I've learned after building two companies while keeping my day job:
>
> Your job isn't the obstacle. It's the foundation.
>
> Think about it. Your job is the investor that funds your experiments. It's the safety net that lets you take risks. It's the stable income that means you don't have to take every client that comes along — you can be selective. You can say no to bad deals because you don't need the money to make rent.
>
> That's leverage. That's power.
>
> The goal isn't escape. The goal is leverage.
>
> *(beat)*
>
> Now, does this mean I'll work a day job forever? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. But I'm not in a rush to find out. Because right now, the day job makes everything else possible. And honestly? I like the work. I'm good at it. And it exposes me to problems I'd never see if I was just sitting in my basement building software.
>
> The employed entrepreneur has advantages that nobody talks about. And that's part of what this show is going to explore."

## THE FIVE PILLARS (1 min intro)

> "So what is The Builder's Frequency actually about?
>
> I've organized the show around five pillars. These are the five things I think about constantly — the topics that keep me up at night, in a good way. And they're what we're going to explore together over the weeks and months ahead.
>
> Let me walk you through each one."

---

## PILLAR 1: AI FOR BUILDERS (2 min)

> "Pillar one: AI for Builders.
>
> I know, I know. Everyone has an AI podcast now. Every LinkedIn influencer is posting about ChatGPT like they invented it. I get it. The hype is exhausting.
>
> But here's why I'm talking about AI anyway: Because I actually use it. Every day. To run my businesses.
>
> I'm not here to speculate about whether AI will take your job or achieve consciousness or turn us all into paperclips. I'm here to show you the practical stuff. The tools that actually save time. The workflows that let one person do the work of three.
>
> I built an AI assistant that helps me manage my content, my calendar, my email. It's not magic. It's not sentient. It's a tool. And like any tool, it's only as good as how you use it.
>
> We'll get into the specifics. The prompts, the automations, the 'here's exactly how I set this up.' No hype. Just practical AI for people who build things."

---

## PILLAR 2: SIDE BUSINESS WHILE EMPLOYED (2 min)

> "Pillar two: Side Business While Employed.
>
> This is the core of what I'm living right now. How do you build something meaningful without quitting your job? What's legal? What's ethical? How do you not get fired? How do you not burn out? How do you tell your boss — or should you even tell your boss?
>
> These are real questions. And most of the advice out there either ignores them or gives you some watered-down 'talk to a lawyer' answer that helps no one.
>
> I'm going to share what actually works. The legal frameworks. The time management systems. The conversations I've had — and the ones I've avoided. This is the playbook I wish someone had given me five years ago."

---

## PILLAR 3: AUDIO/HARDWARE ENGINEERING (2 min)

> "Pillar three: Audio and Hardware Engineering.
>
> Okay, this one's niche. I'll admit it. Not everyone cares about acoustic measurement or test automation for manufacturing. If that's not your thing, feel free to skip these episodes. I won't be offended.
>
> *(beat)*
>
> Actually, I will be a little offended. But I'll get over it.
>
> Here's why I'm including this: It's my craft. It's what I know better than almost anything else. And while the specifics are niche, the principles are universal. Systems thinking. Quality engineering. Building processes that scale. These ideas apply whether you're testing speakers or shipping software or running a restaurant.
>
> Plus, there are a lot of engineers out there who feel like they're just turning cranks. Closing tickets. Shipping features. And they've lost touch with why engineering is actually cool. I want to bring some of that back."

---

## PILLAR 4: FAITH AND BUSINESS (2 min)

> "Pillar four: Faith and Business.
>
> This is the one where I lose some of you. And that's okay.
>
> I'm a man of faith. Judeo-Christian worldview. I believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And I don't think you have to put that in a box when you go to work.
>
> Most business content treats faith like it's separate. Or worse, incompatible. Like ambition is somehow sinful. Like making money means you've sold out.
>
> I don't buy that. I think there are principles — ancient principles — that make you a better entrepreneur. A better leader. A better human. And I want to explore how those principles apply in the real world. Not in a preachy way. I'm not here to convert you. But I'm also not going to hide this part of who I am.
>
> If that's not your thing, that's fine. But I think you might be surprised how practical some of this is."

---

## PILLAR 5: BUILDING LEGACY (2 min)

> "Pillar five: Building Legacy.
>
> This is the why behind everything else.
>
> I'm not building companies to get rich. I mean, I wouldn't say no to getting rich. But that's not the point.
>
> Everything I'm doing, I'm doing for my sons. For my family. For the people who come after me. I want to build something that outlasts me. Something I can hand down. Not just money — although that would be nice — but knowledge. Systems. A way of thinking about the world.
>
> I want Jones and Jett to grow up seeing their dad build things. Not just consume. Not just complain. Build.
>
> That's the legacy. That's what I'm playing for."

---

## WHO THIS IS FOR (2 min)

> "So who is this show actually for?
>
> Let me be specific, because I think one of the problems with podcasts is they try to be for everyone and end up being for no one.
>
> If you're a corporate employee with a dream you haven't killed yet — this is for you. Maybe you've been sitting on a business idea for years. Maybe you've started and stopped three times. Maybe you're just tired of making someone else rich while your own projects collect dust. I see you.
>
> If you're an engineer who thinks there's more to life than tickets and sprints and standups — this is for you. You got into this because you wanted to build cool stuff. And somewhere along the way, it turned into meetings about meetings. I get it.
>
> If you're a believer who's been told that ambition is sinful — that wanting more is somehow ungrateful — this is for you. That's not what I believe. And I think you'll find some freedom here.
>
> If you're a parent trying to figure out how to build something meaningful AND be present for your kids — this is for you. It's a hard balance. I don't have it figured out. But I'm working on it in public.
>
> *(beat)*
>
> Now, let me tell you who this is NOT for.
>
> If you want someone to tell you to quit your job tomorrow and follow your passion — you're in the wrong place. That's not what I teach. That's not what I believe. Passion is great, but it doesn't pay the mortgage.
>
> If you want get-rich-quick schemes or passive income hacks or whatever the hustle bros are selling this week — this isn't that. Building real things takes time. There are no shortcuts. If you're looking for shortcuts, there are plenty of other podcasts that will lie to you. This isn't one of them."

---

## WHAT TO EXPECT (1.5 min)

> "So what can you expect if you keep showing up?
>
> Here's the format. Every week, one episode. Usually 20 to 30 minutes — long enough to go deep, short enough that you can listen on a commute.
>
> Some episodes will be tactical. Step by step. 'Here's exactly how I did this thing, and here's how you can do it too.'
>
> Some will be stories. 'Here's what happened to me, here's what went wrong, here's what I learned.' I'll share the failures too. The stuff that didn't work. I think we learn more from failures than wins, but nobody wants to talk about them. I will.
>
> Some will be frameworks. Mental models. 'Here's a way to think about this problem that might help you.'
>
> I'll occasionally bring on guests — people who are doing interesting things, building interesting companies. But mostly, it's going to be you and me. I'm not trying to build a media empire. I'm not chasing sponsors or downloads or whatever vanity metrics podcasters chase.
>
> I'm just trying to share what I'm learning while I'm still learning it. That's it."

## WHY "THE BUILDER'S FREQUENCY" (1.5 min)

> "Before I wrap up, let me explain the name. Because people keep asking.
>
> Why 'The Builder's Frequency'?
>
> Two reasons.
>
> First, I'm an audio engineer. Frequency is the language I speak. Literally. I spend my days thinking about frequencies — hertz, kilohertz, frequency response curves. It's kind of my thing.
>
> But second, and more importantly, I believe builders operate on a different frequency. Not better — different.
>
> We see opportunities where others see problems. We think in decades while others think in quarters. We're playing a different game with different rules on a different timeline.
>
> And if you're a builder, you know what I'm talking about. You know that feeling of being slightly out of sync with everyone around you. They're watching TV; you're sketching business models. They're scrolling social media; you're reading documentation for some obscure API.
>
> We're tuned to a different channel.
>
> This show is that channel. Your weekly signal. A frequency you can tune into when the noise gets loud and you need a reminder that you're not crazy."

---

## CLOSING - ECCLESIASTES (1.5 min)

> "I want to end with this.
>
> There's a verse in Ecclesiastes that's been on my mind lately. It says, 'Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.'
>
> Now, some people read that as permission to be a workaholic. To grind 24/7. To sacrifice everything at the altar of productivity. That's not what it means.
>
> I think it's a call to presence. To excellence. To showing up fully for whatever you're building — whether that's a company, a family, a friendship, or just this moment right now.
>
> It's about doing the thing in front of you with everything you've got. Not half-assing two things. Not scrolling while you're 'working.' Not being at home but mentally at the office.
>
> Whatever your hand finds to do. Do it with all your might.
>
> I try to take that seriously. Some days I succeed. A lot of days I don't. But it's the standard I'm aiming for. And I hope it resonates with you too."

---

## CALL TO ACTION (1 min)

> "Okay. If you've made it this far, thank you. Genuinely.
>
> Here's what I'd ask of you:
>
> Subscribe. Wherever you're listening — Spotify, Apple, YouTube, wherever — hit that button. I know every podcast asks you to subscribe, and it feels like a meaningless ritual at this point. But it actually matters. It tells the algorithms that real humans are listening, and algorithms decide who sees what these days.
>
> If you want to go deeper, I write a weekly newsletter. Same name — The Builder's Frequency. I share things there that don't make it into the podcast. Insights, resources, stuff I'm reading and thinking about. Link's in the show notes. It's free. I'm not trying to sell you anything.
>
> And if this episode resonated with you — if you know someone who's building something on the side, or wrestling with these same questions — send it to them. That's how shows like this grow. Not through ads or viral clips, but through people saying, 'Hey, I think you'd like this.'
>
> That's it. No sales pitch. No course. No mastermind. Just subscribe, maybe share, and show up next week."

## OUTRO (15 sec)

> "That's The Builder's Frequency. I'm Joshua Levy.
>
> Keep building. I'll see you next week."
